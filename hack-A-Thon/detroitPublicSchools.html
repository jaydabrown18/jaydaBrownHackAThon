            <p>As the years pass, our education system begins to expand. The question is, “Is it in the way we hope it would?” In the case of the Detroit Public Schools, the education system has not been kind. Kids at these schools are learning in terrible conditions but the school district has not done much to change it. The schools need $532 million to be able to fix the repairs. The district even came up with a plan to use the covid relief money but nothing has been done yet. These repairs are vital to a safe environment for the kids that attend these public schools. A few of the repairs consist of Inoperable boilers, Corroded plumbing fixtures, Missing ceiling tiles in classrooms, Exterior walls with cracks, Roof leaks, and Incomplete fire alarm systems. To make matter worst is these schools can not collect a single penny from taxes to get these problems fixed. It is so sad to see that these are suffering from the consequence of poorly kept facilities. </p>

            <p>In school, there is a lot of pressure for students to perform well. Constant assignments, projects, maintaining grades, etc. What makes matters worst is when the teacher who is supposed to be there to help you learn and succeed, doesn’t care. In the Detroit schools, some teachers have been known to put less effort into teaching and caring for their students. I believe this is due to the environment. How could someone be happy and cheerful in an environment like these schools? A mother had this problem with her 11-year-old son. Her son was struggling academically and had very bad behavior. When she tried to come to her son’s teacher, her complaints were taken with a grain of salt. When she tried to find another school for her son to attend, she had zero luck. Turns out, the other school in the district was just as bad as the one her son was attending. These kids have nowhere to go, no one to turn to, and no one to care for them like school should care for their students.</p>

            <p>The Detroit schools have a reputation of appearing to be underfunded and a dangerous environment to work in. Parents have stated that to get around in the Detroit public schools, you have to be a good “fighter” to get into a good school. These public schools have had trouble with violence at the school. There are metal detectors at the entrance to prevent gun violence and weapon from coming into the school. How are these kids possibly suppose to feel safe or comfortable in these schools if they have to go through metal detectors so they can be protected from the violence outside the school’s doors? This is not the only problem with violence at these schools.</p>
